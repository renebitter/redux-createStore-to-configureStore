# redux-createStore-to-configureStore

Cloned a finished project and tested upgrading it.

1. Upgraded all dependencies with 'yarn upgrade-interactive --latest'
2. Fixed all old code manually (e.g. changes from React v16 to v18)
3. Updated Redux code to configureStore and removed unnecessary code (e.g. middleware, combineReducers)
